             <h1>General Information</h1>
             <p>
                First of all this website was a side project<br/>
                meant to practice code, 
                The club was first thought up in 2023, although<br/>
                unfortunetly we were unable to go through with it<br/>
                due to unforseen circumstances. We look forward<br/>
                to going through with the idea this school year,<br/>
                and we thank mr. Duey for making it possible by<br/>
                sponsoring us and giving us access to the weight<br/>
                room. Updates on which days we will be open will<br/>
                be posted on the live updates section, as of yet<br/>
                we don't know.</p>

            <h1>Why You Should Join</h1>
             <p>The club offers many opportunities you wouldn't<br/>
                otherwise see working out solo. Can be beneficial<br/>
                to any athlete at PG. Here are a few benefits:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>A scoop of pre on entrance</li>
                  <li>Is a good place to learn and improve, teeming <br/>
                    with experienced athletes who can offer advice<br/>
                    in any sport or team you might want to join</li>
                  <li>Offers a place for those who don't have a lot<br/>
                      time after school to workout</li>
                  <li>Will add to your school experience with events,<br/>
                      competitions, and opportunities to win and be <br/>
                      recognized</li>
                  <li>Being a part of one of the most uplifting,<br/>
                      rewarding, and positive communities at PG</li>
                  </ol>

            <h1>What You Can Expect</h1>
            <p>While this is still a work in progress, here what we<br/>
               have so far: We will try to organize what we are<br/>
               training as a group per session, however we understand<br/>
               that everyone has their own schedule and shouldn't<br/>
               have to adheer to ours so it will be open gym for most<br/>
               days. Besides that, we plan to organize events such as<br/>
               friendly competitions between members, and a record<br/>
               board for people to be able to set goals. Prizes for<br/>
               such events could be anything from awards, to gift<br/>
               cards, or things like wrist straps and the like<br/>
               (DISCLAIMER! student council, this is not a bribe.<br/>
                Rather a celebraion of well earned accomplishments)<br/></p>
