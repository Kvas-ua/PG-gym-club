                  <p>
                     First of all this website was a side project<br/>
                     meant to practice code, 
                     The club was first thought up in 2023, although<br/>
                     unfortunetly we were unable to go through with it<br/>
                     due to unforseen circumstances. We look forward<br/>
                     to going through with the idea this school year,<br/>
                     and we thank mr. Duey for making it possible by<br/>
                     sponsoring us and giving us access to the weight<br/>
                     room. Updates on which days we will be open will<br/>
                     be posted on the live updates section, as of yet<br/>
                     we don't know.</p>

                 <h1>Why You Should Join</h1>
                  <p>The club offers many opportunities you wouldn't<br/>
                     otherwise see working out solo. Can be beneficial<br/>
                     to any athlete at PG. Here are a few benefits:</p>
                     <ol>
                       <li>A scoop of pre on entrance</li>
                       <li>Is a good place to learn and improve, teeming <br/>
                         with experienced athletes who can offer advice<br/>
                         in any sport or team you might want to join</li>
                       <li>Offers a place for those who don't have a lot<br/>
                           time after school to workout</li>
                       <li>Will add to your school experience with events,<br/>
                           competitions, and opportunities to win and be <br/>
                           recognized</li>
                       <li>Being a part of one of the most uplifting,<br/>
                           rewarding, and positive communities at PG</li>
                       </ol>

                 <h1>What You Can Expect</h1>
                 <p>While this is still a work in progress, here what we<br/>
                    have so far: We will try to organize what we are<br/>
                    training as a group per session, however we understand<br/>
                    that everyone has their own schedule and shouldn't<br/>
                    have to adheer to ours so it will be open gym for most<br/>
                    days. Besides that, we plan to organize events such as<br/>
                    friendly competitions between members, and a record<br/>
                    board for people to be able to set goals. Prizes for<br/>
                    such events could be anything from awards, to gift<br/>
                    cards, or things like wrist straps and the like<br/>
                    (DISCLAIMER! student council, this is not a bribe.<br/>
                     Rather a celebraion of well earned accomplishments)<br/></p>
